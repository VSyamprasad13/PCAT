Assignment 3: Function Design and Modularization - Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: 
one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. 
Include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization.

psedocode for factorial and fibonacci:

function factorial(num)
  declare fact=1
  for i from num to 1
    fact=fact*i
  print "Factorail is "+fact

function fibonacci(a,b,num1){
	for i from 0 to num1-1
      c=a+b
      a=b
      b=c
      print c
}
start
declare num
accept num
call factorial(num)
declare a=0,b=1
declare num1
accept num1
print a
print b
call fibonacci(a,b,num1-2)
end

Explanation: By using modularity we can use the same driver code for both the psedocodes. By this we can reduce the code.
we call the function which are necessary.
