Assignment 2: Recursive Function and Efficiency Analysis - Write a recursive function pseudocode and calculate
the nth Fibonacci number and use Big O notation to analyze its efficiency. Compare this with an iterative 
approach and discuss the pros and cons in terms of space and timeÂ complexity.

function fibonacci(a,b,num){
	if num>0
		print a+b
		fibonacci(b,a+b,num--)
}

start
declare a=0,b=1
declare num
accept num
print a
print b
call fibonacci(a,b,num-2)
end

Explanation:
By using recursive function we can easily calculate the fibonacci sequence.
space complexity is more in recursive approach compared to iterative approach
time complexity is more in recursive approach compared to iterative approach
