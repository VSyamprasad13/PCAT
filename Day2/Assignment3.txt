Assignment 3: Function Design and Modularization - Create a document that describes the design of two modular functions: 
one that returns the factorial of a number, and another that calculates the nth Fibonacci number. 
Include pseudocode and a brief explanation of how modularity in programming helps with code reuse and organization.

psedocode for factorial:

function factorial(num)
  if(num<=1)
    return 1
  else return num*factorial(num-1)

start
declare num
accept num
result = call factorial(num)
end

Explanation: By using modularity with recursion the code becomes less compared to normal execution.

psedocode for fibonacci:
